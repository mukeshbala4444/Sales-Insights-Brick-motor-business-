**Description:**  

As part of a resume challenge project by Codebasics, led by Dhaval Patel sir and Hemanand Vadivel sir , I undertook a comprehensive market analysis for AtliQ Motors, a major player in the electric vehicle (EV) sector. Tasked with analyzing the EV and hybrid vehicle market in India, I assumed the role of Peter Pandey, a data analyst at AtliQ Motors.



**Key Deliverables:**

- **Market Research & Analysis:** Conducted an in-depth study of the EV/Hybrid market in India, identifying trends, consumer preferences, and competitor performance.

- **Dashboard Design:** Created an interactive and self-explanatory dashboard using [insert tool used, e.g., Tableau/Power BI/Excel] to visualize key metrics and insights. This dashboard served as a decision-making tool for AtliQ Motors' expansion strategy in India.

- **Presentation:** Delivered a concise and compelling audio-visual presentation to the chief editor, Bruce Haryali, highlighting strategic insights and recommendations for AtliQ Motors' market entry and expansion in India.
